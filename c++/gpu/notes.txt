324423 is right for AxB, A.TxB
342243 is right for AxB.T
n is rows of B, m is cols of A, r is cols of result
n is cols of A/rows of B
m is rows of A
r is cols of B
start by considering NON transposed matrices:

3x2, 2x4

4x3, 4x2
n is first dim
m is col of a
r is col of b

3x2, 4x2
n is 3
m is 2
r is 4
42244 : 7 9 11 13 8 10 12 14
result to new:
43344 : 23 29 35 41 53 67 81 95 83 105 127 149

AxB:
result is nxm (arXac)
no transpose
multiply is nrmmrn (arXbcXac)
transpose result is rnnrr (bcXar)

A.TxB
result is mxr
transpose is nxm
transpose is nmmnn
multiply is mrnnrm
tranpose result is rmmrr

AxB.T
result is nxr
transpose is mxr
transpose is rmmrr (42244)
multiply is nrmmrn (342243)
transpose result is rnnrr (43344)

0->9

weights up to 1.0 will cause massive results for a1 and will make deltas impossible
